TODO:

	Panda1.vhd - Test the Register interface no longer needed?

	Implemented design 'Check Timing' warnings (Constraints file?):
		
		Ports with no input delay (4): 
			ETH1_MDIO   FMC_CLK1_M2C_N   IO0_D20_P   IO0_D21_N
		Ports with no output delay (2): 
			DDR4PL_RST_N   ETH1_MDIO  
		Ports with no output delay but user has a false path constraint (1):
			LED1_N
		Ports with no output delay but with a timing clock defined on it or propagating through it (2)
			ETH1_MDC   ETH1_TXCLK



Software Issues

	PS and PL LEDs... Work individually, but have not been included in main code.

	Serial-Pass relay drive not implemented?

	IN/OUT ENC - Can software-block names be matched to axes? (3 and 4 are axes 5 and 6).

	axi_lite_slave.vhd - only a subset of the some ack lines are used (see lines 196-206 and 252-261)

	SFP Power-Up reset not working.  Probably due to reset_i coming from axi_reset not server startup.
	  	(clock currently comes from ST1 clock-gen which isn't set upt until kernel boots)


Hardware that isn't implemented in GUI:

	EQU Inputs
	AUX SPI
	System Information (CPU Temps etc)
	LoS inputs from Quad Decoders
	Pulse-Direction inputs.
	Bi-directional data on the serial inputs (EnDat?)
	Watchdog and Abort
	

Hardware that is in the GUI but isn't on the board

	Terminating resistor on TTLIN is now jumper on the board, needs removing from SW Block.



Things that need looking at:

	Compatibility string in driver/hardware
	IDDR -> IDDRE-4 in IDDR_sync_bit.vhd
	pulse_queue.tcl... depth 256 not valid, changed both in and out to 512.
	        - and all three fifo IPs defaulting to ooc (which doesn't work in RTL-module)
	        - also, none of them had data_count ports. 

	LoS not working, and nowhere to display it.
	Reset on PandA-Brick has been wired to AXI-bus reset, which comes from ps_sys_rst (is this correct?).
